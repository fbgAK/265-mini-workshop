Chads in-class tutorial

Feedback: 

Overall easy to do, this was a fun task since ive never added a video onto a page before. This is also valueable knowledge to know for the future aswell. For improvement I would love to see more styling like a border or animation such as hovering that you could implement onto the page giving the video a more sleek look.
